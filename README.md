# Vulnerability Checker

This Python script is designed to check for various web application vulnerabilities:

## Features

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability Check

The `check_sql_injection` function checks for SQL Injection vulnerabilities by injecting a malicious SQL payload into the specified URL. If the response contains an SQL syntax error, the script identifies the vulnerability.

### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Vulnerability Check

The `check_xss` function checks for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting a malicious script payload into the specified URL. The script then parses the response using BeautifulSoup to identify if the injected script is present.

### 3. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Vulnerability Check

The `check_csrf` function checks for CSRF vulnerabilities by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection on a login form. It retrieves the CSRF token from the form, crafts a POST request with a CSRF exploit, and checks if the login was successful to identify the vulnerability.

## Usage

To use this script, replace the following placeholders with your actual URLs and CSRF token name:

- `target_url`: The URL of the vulnerable page to be tested for SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
- `csrf_url`: The URL of the login page vulnerable to CSRF.
- `csrf_token_name`: The name of the CSRF token input field on the login form.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with the actual URLs and CSRF token name
    target_url = "http://example.com/vulnerable_page?id="
    csrf_url = "http://example.com/login"
    csrf_token_name = "csrf_token"  # Replace with the actual CSRF token name
    
    # Check for vulnerabilities
    check_sql_injection(target_url)
    check_xss(target_url)
    check_csrf(csrf_url, csrf_token_name)
